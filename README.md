# MoBa_data_cleaning

Files `MoBa_cleaning_MaternalHeightWeight.R` and `MoBa_imputing_MaternalHeightWeight.R` can be used as-is, on .csv files freshly made from the databases. The outputs can then be used as phenotypes or covariates themselves, or used together with `SGA-LGA_definitions_in_MoBa/` repository scripts to produce customized growth curves.

I do not take responsibility for the content/documentation of all other scripts in this repo.
