README file for CLEANING_MOBA_FILES folder

(these scripts were written in Summer 2014 to clean the child/mother athropometric data for analysis of CaffeineIntake vs BirthOutcomes)

- numbered scripts (e.g. "1-1_name.R") contain cleaning/flagging functions
- they are run from the master script ("MASTER-SCRIPT_detecting_outliers.R")
- spss syntax files exports the data from SPSS to the R-acceptable format
- the raw data file is created in spss by merging MFR and multiple questionnaires 
- folders are used to collect the visual reports from cleaning steps
- other scripts (not numbered or not called MASTER) contain alternative/additional approaches

note that scripts were written long time ago and could be optimised
